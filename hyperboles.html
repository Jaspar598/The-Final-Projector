      This chapter will focus on three of the 12 principles of animation, Squash
      and Stretch, Anticipation, <br />
      and Exaggeration.
    </h2>
    <p>
      These principles are what truly brings animation to life because of the
      way that they exaggerate motion in a way that is appealing to the viewer.
      Without these three principles, animations would feel stiff and lifeless.

      <h2>Squash and Stretch</h2>
      <p>
        Squash and Stretch is the principle that gives a sense of weight and
        flexibility to objects. It is used to show the impact of forces on an
        object, such as gravity or momentum. For example, when a ball bounces,
        it squashes when it hits the ground and stretches as it lifts off. This
        principle can also be used to exaggerate facial expressions and body
        movements, making characters more dynamic and expressive.

      <h2>Anticipation</h2>
      <p>
        Anticipation is the principle that prepares the audience for an action
        that is about to happen. It is used to create a sense of expectation and
        build tension before a movement occurs. For example, before a character
        jumps, they may crouch down slightly to prepare for the leap. This
        principle helps to make movements feel more natural and believable,
        enhancing the overall impact of the animation.

      <h2>Exaggeration</h2>
      <p>
        Exaggeration is the principle that amplifies movements and expressions
        to make them more visually interesting and engaging. It is used to
        emphasize key actions and emotions, making them more memorable for the
        audience. For example, a character's reaction to a surprise might be
        exaggerated with wide eyes and an open mouth to convey shock more
        effectively. This principle helps to create a stronger connection
        between the audience and the characters, enhancing the overall impact of
        the animation.
