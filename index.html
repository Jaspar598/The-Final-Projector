          <h1>12 Principles of Animation</h1>
          <p>
            The 12 Principles of Animation were developed by Disney animators
            Ollie Johnston and Frank Thomas in their 1981 book "The Illusion of
            Life: Disney Animation." These principles are still used by
            animators today. The principles names are as follows:

            Each principle is designed to enhance the believability and
            emotional impact of animated characters and objects. By applying
            these principles, animators can create more dynamic and engaging
            animations that capture audiences' attention and convey a sense of
            life and personality. Here are brief, practical examples and tips
            for each principle:<br /><br />
            <strong>Squash and Stretch</strong> — Emphasize volume and
            flexibility to show weight and impact (e.g., a bouncing ball
            squashes on contact and stretches as it lifts).<br /><br />
            <strong>Anticipation</strong> — Add a small preparatory move before
            a big action (a character crouches before jumping) to make motion
            readable.<br /><br />
            <strong>Staging</strong> — Use clear poses, lighting, and
            composition so the audience immediately understands the action and
            focus.<br /><br />
            <strong>Straight Ahead and Pose to Pose</strong> — Straight ahead
            animation creates fluid spontaneity; pose-to-pose builds strong key
            poses and controlled timing. Combine both for balance.<br /><br />
            <strong>Follow Through and Overlapping Action</strong> — Let parts
            of a character continue moving after the main action stops (hair,
            clothing, tails) to avoid rigid stops.<br /><br />
            <strong>Slow In and Slow Out</strong> — Add more frames at the start
            and end of an action to create believable acceleration and
            deceleration.<br /><br />
            <strong>Arcs</strong> — Most natural motion follows curved paths;
            use arcs to make movement feel organic and graceful.<br /><br />
            <strong>Secondary Action</strong> — Layer small actions (a sigh, a
            hand gesture) that support the main motion without distracting from
            it.<br /><br />
            <strong>Timing</strong> — Control the number of frames and spacing
            to convey weight, mood, and personality; faster for light/energetic,
            slower for heavy/solemn.<br /><br />
            <strong>Exaggeration</strong> — Push poses and expressions beyond
            realism to strengthen clarity and emotional impact while keeping
            believability.<br /><br />
            <strong>Solid Drawing</strong> — Maintain consistent volume, weight,
            and anatomy in drawings so forms feel three-dimensional and
            believable.<br /><br />
            <strong>Appeal</strong> — Design characters and poses with clear
            silhouettes, readable expressions, and a distinct personality that
            the audience connects with. Practice tip: study classic animation,
            break scenes into key poses, and repeat short exercises (bouncing
            ball, walk cycles, simple acting shots). Combine principles
            deliberately, test variations in timing and spacing, and iterate
            until the motion reads clearly and emotionally.
