      This chapter will focus on two of the 12 principles of animation, Staging
      and Appeal.
    </h2>
    <p>
      These principles focus on the design and presentation of characters and
      settings in animation. They are essential for creating engaging and
      memorable animations that captivate audiences.

      <h2>Staging</h2>
      <p>
        Staging is the principle that focuses on the presentation of characters
        and settings in a way that is clear and visually appealing. It involves
        the use of composition, lighting, and camera angles to direct the
        audience's attention to the most important elements of a scene. For
        example, a character might be positioned in the center of the frame with
        dramatic lighting to emphasize their importance. This principle helps to
        create a strong visual impact and enhance the overall storytelling of
        the animation.

      <h2>Appeal</h2>
      <p>
        Appeal is the principle that focuses on the design and personality of
        characters to make them visually interesting and engaging. It involves
        the use of shapes, colors, and proportions to create characters that are
        memorable and likable. For example, a character with exaggerated
        features and a unique color palette can stand out and capture the
        audience's attention. This principle helps to create a strong emotional
        connection between the audience and the characters, enhancing the
        overall impact of the animation.
