          <h1>Movement</h1>
          <h2 style="margin-right: 25vh;">This chapter will focus on five of the 12 principles of animation:
            Follow through and overlapping action, Slow In and Slow Out, Arcs,
            Secondary Action, and Timing.</h2>
          <p>
            These principles are essential for
            creating smooth and natural movement in animation.
          </p>
          <div class="squash-and-stretch">
            <h2>Follow Through and Overlapping Action</h2>
            <p>
              This principle states that different parts of an animated figure
              will continue to move after the main part or center of gravity has
              stopped. For example, if a character is running and suddenly
              stops, their hair should swing forward and continue its motion
              before stopping.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="squash-and-stretch">
            <h2>Slow In and Slow Out</h2>
            <p>
              This principle states that movements shoulds start and end slowly
              by adding more frames near the beginning and end of a movement.
              This creates a more natural and realistic motion that emphasizes
              the acceleration and deceleration of objects.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="squash-and-stretch">
            <h2>Arcs</h2>
            <p>
              This principle simply states that most natural movements follow an
              arc or circular path instead of rigid motions, and thus, actions
              should be animated as such.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="squash-and-stretch">
            <h2>Secondary Action</h2>
            <p>
              This principle states that additional actions should be added to compliment a main action. This adds more dimension to the character animation and helps to support the main action. For example, a character walking might swing their arms or have their clothes move slightly with each step.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="squash-and-stretch">
          <h2>Timing</h2>
          <p>
            This principle refers to the number of frames used for a given
            action, which affects the speed and rhythm of the movement. Proper
            timing can convey weight, emotion, and personality in animated
            characters.
