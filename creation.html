        This chapter will focus on 2 of the 12 principles of animation, Straight
        ahead and Pose to Pose and Solid <br />Drawing.
      </h2>
      <p>
        These principles are more behind the scenes than actual animation. They
        are simple rules of thumb to help animators accomplish their goals in an
        efficient and timely manner.

        <h2>Straight ahead and Pose to Pose</h2>
        <p>
          These are two different approaches to creating animation. Straight
          ahead animation involves drawing each frame in sequence from start to
          finish, while pose to pose animation involves creating key poses first
          and then filling in the in-between frames later. Both techniques have
          their advantages and disadvantages, and animators often use a
          combination of both to achieve the desired effect.

        <h2>Solid Drawing</h2>
        <p>
          This principle emphasizes the importance of creating characters and
          objects that have a sense of weight, volume, and three-dimensionality.
          Animators should strive to create drawings that are well-constructed
          and believable, with a clear understanding of anatomy, perspective,
          and lighting. This helps to create a more immersive and engaging
          experience for the viewer.
